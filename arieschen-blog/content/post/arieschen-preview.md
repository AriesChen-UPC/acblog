Hello! My name is **Aries Chen**, and I'm a dedicated student at the **China University of Petroleum**, specializing in **Geophysics**. 

My academic journey is deeply rooted in the exploration of the earth's physical properties, but I've recently taken a keen interest in the realm of **Artificial Intelligence**. 

I'm currently engaged in AI-related research, focusing on how these advanced technologies can be applied within geophysical studies to unveil new insights and efficiencies.

Outside the academic world, I have a profound passion for literature and endurance sports, particularly **marathon** running. 

Reading allows me to travel through different worlds and ideas, broadening my perspective and fueling my creativity. Running, on the other hand, offers me a unique challenge and the opportunity to push my limits. Participating in a full marathon annually has become a tradition for me, symbolizing resilience, persistence, and the continuous pursuit of personal excellence.
