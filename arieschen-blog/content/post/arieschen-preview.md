Hello! My name is **Aries Chen**, and I am a committed student at the [China University of Petroleum](https://www.upc.edu.cn/), where I major in Geophysics. Recently, I have developed a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence. <u>I am actively involved in AI research, exploring how these cutting-edge technologies can enhance geophysical studies by providing new insights and improving efficiencies.</u>

Beyond academia, I am deeply passionate about literature and endurance sports, especially marathons. Reading opens up various worlds and ideas for me, expanding my perspective and stimulating my creativity. Meanwhile, running presents a distinct challenge, giving me the chance to test and extend my boundaries.
